                <p>Once during a meeting in which we were discussing the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher%E2%80%93Yates_shuffle">Fischer-Yates shuffle</a>, someone asked:
"How many times do we need to run the algorithm to see every permutation?"  It immediately occurred
to me that, well, I didn't know.  Feeling my hands begin wave, instinctively, I fired back, I
thought, quite cleverly: "How many times do you need to flip a coin to see both sides?".  Of course,
both questions are somewhat non-sensical, but the intent of the former question, unlike the latter,
was clear. I didn't know the answer, but I've always said that stopping problems are the best
problems, so even though I didn't have a great answer in the moment, I resolved to find something
satisfying. At this point I will confess that I am an enthusiastic yet rank amateur
combinatorialist.  For whatever reason, I had never heard of the Coupon Collector.</p>
<p>This will take you on a seemingly circuitous path towards something that is in the end very simple,
and very beautiful.  I think it also proves that when all else fails, brute force counting can take
you a long way, provided you have the machinery to get you there.</p>
<h3>Flipping a coin to see both sides</h3>
<p>The first matter of business was to pose the question in a way that was actually solvable.  First,
think about the case of the coin, or a <span class="math">\(2\)</span>-die.  If you had to pick a single number of times to
flip it, knowing nothing about the coin, and your life depended on seeing both sides, you'd obviously
want to pick the biggest number you could.  A more interesting question along those lines is: what
is the smallest number you could pick to have a reasonable probability of success? If we take this a
step further and treat this more like a stopping problem, we would think about doing experiments
which generate sequences in which the <span class="math">\(m\)</span>-th event is <span class="math">\(H\)</span> or <span class="math">\(T\)</span> and the <span class="math">\(m-1\)</span> are all either <span class="math">\(T\)</span> or
<span class="math">\(H\)</span> respectively.  Then a meaningful probabilistic statement about the situation is to ask: Let
<span class="math">\(X\)</span> be a random variable which represents length <span class="math">\(n\)</span> of sequences generated by flipping a coin until
you see both sides. What is <span class="math">\(E[n]\)</span>? We proceeded by brute force.</p>
<p>If we start enumerating the possibilities, we can see the patterns of different length.  For the
sequences of length at most <span class="math">\(m\)</span>,</p>
<div class="math">\begin{align}
S_m = &amp;HT + TH + \nonumber\\
    &amp;HHT + TTH + \ldots \nonumber\\
    &amp;H^{m-1}T + T^{m-1}H. \label{coin_sum}\\
\end{align}</div>
<p>It's interesting that the generation of length <span class="math">\(k\)</span> is easy to <em>generate</em> from the <span class="math">\(k-1\)</span>th by simply
prepending the opposite of the terminal token, which doesn't change.  The production rule here is
quite simple.  Anyway, if we think about <span class="math">\(H\)</span> and <span class="math">\(T\)</span> as probabilities, <span class="math">\(S_\infty\)</span> better be <span class="math">\(1\)</span>, so
we can evaluate by collecting terms.</p>
<div class="math">\begin{align}
S_{\infty} &amp;= T\left(H + H^2 + H^3 + \ldots\right) + H\left(T + T^2 + T^3 + \ldots\right)\nonumber\\
&amp;= T\left(\frac{1}{1-H} - 1\right) + H\left(\frac{1}{1-T} - 1\right)\nonumber\\
&amp;= HT\left(\frac{1}{1-H} + \frac{1}{1-T}\right)\label{S}\\
\end{align}</div>
<p>At this point, it's probably time to stop treating <span class="math">\(H\)</span> and <span class="math">\(T\)</span> symbolically and replace them with the probabilities <span class="math">\(P(H) = p\)</span>, <span class="math">\(P(T) = q\)</span> and <span class="math">\(p + q = 1\)</span>. Accordingly, <span class="math">\(H \rightarrow p\)</span>, <span class="math">\(T \rightarrow q\)</span>:</p>
<div class="math">\begin{align}
S_\infty &amp;= pq\left(\frac{1}{q} + \frac{1}{p}\right)\nonumber\\
         &amp;= pq \left(\frac{p+q}{pq}\right) = 1.
\end{align}</div>
<p>Whew!  Now to calculate <span class="math">\(E[n]\)</span> we promote <span class="math">\(S_k\)</span> to a PDF, and evaluate the sum:
</p>
<div class="math">\begin{align}
E[n] = \,&amp;2(pq + qp)\, + \nonumber\\
    &amp;3(ppq + qqp) + \ldots \nonumber\\
    &amp;m(p^{m-1}q + q^{m-1}p) + \ldots\nonumber\\
\end{align}</div>
<p>
Reorganizing, we see that
</p>
<div class="math">\begin{align}
E[n] &amp;= q\left(2p + 3p^2 + \ldots mp^{m-1} + \ldots\right) + p\left(2q + 3p^2 + \ldots mq^{m-1} + \ldots \right) \nonumber\\
    &amp;= \frac{q}{p} \left(\sum_{i=1}^\infty ip^i - p\right) + \frac{p}{q} \left(\sum_{i=1}^\infty iq^i - q\right)\nonumber\\
&amp;= \frac{q}{p}\left(\frac{p}{q^2} - p\right) + \frac{p}{q}\left(\frac{q}{p^2} - q\right)\nonumber\\
&amp;= \frac{p}{q}\left(\frac{1}{1-q} - q\right) + \frac{q}{p}\left(\frac{1}{1-p} - p\right)\nonumber\\
&amp;= \frac{1 - pq}{p(1-p)}\nonumber\\
&amp;= \frac{p^2 - p + 1}{p(1-p)}\label{old_way}\\
&amp;= 2 + \frac{p^3 + q^3}{pq}\nonumber\\
\end{align}</div>
<p>This was new to me. For <span class="math">\(p = q\)</span> we have that <span class="math">\(E[n] = 3\)</span>. </p>
<h3>Working our way towards <span class="math">\(n!\)</span></h3>
<p>Having solved the problem for <span class="math">\(m = 2\)</span>, the next thing to do was to try for higher <span class="math">\(m\)</span>'s.  There
seemed to be three immediately interesting cases to explore, potentially for each <span class="math">\(m\)</span>: </p>
<div class="math">\begin{align}
&amp;\text{All equal probabilities, i.e. } p_k = 1/m \text{ for } 1 \leq k \leq m\label{typeA}\tag{A}.\\
&amp;\text{One distinctive } p_j \text{ and all other } p \text{'s equal.}\label{typeB}\tag{B}.\\
&amp;\text{Arbitrary } p_k \text{ subject to  } \sum p_k = 1.\label{typeC}\tag{C}\\
\end{align}</div>
<p>These are in increasing order of difficulty. So, case <span class="math">\((\ref{typeA})\)</span> was next up.</p>
<p>The first thing that happened when we tried do do something like <span class="math">\((\ref{coin_sum})\)</span> for <span class="math">\(m=3\)</span>, was
that the production rules really weren't that obvious anymore once we got past a few generations.
And proceeding this way under cases <span class="math">\(B\)</span> and <span class="math">\(C\)</span> was fear-inspiring.  We needed a tool to keep things under control.</p>
<p>Astute readers will have noticed that I italicized a certain word above, namely <em>generate</em>, which
should have tipped you off to what's coming next.
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/generatingfunctionology-Third-Herbert-S-Wilf/dp/1568812795">Generating Functions</a>
are the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caterpillar_D11">D11</a> of the brute-forcing amateur
combinatorialist community.  I remembered some advice from <em>Knuth et. al.</em> in
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Concrete-Mathematics-Foundation-Computer-Science/dp/0201558025">Concrete Mathematics</a>
to use finite automata to keep mayhem from breaking out in the production rules.  But before we get
to that, it's first useful to introduce the machinery that we will use when we get there.</p>
<h3>The coin redux, this time as a PGF</h3>
<p>I'm not going to do justice to generating functions in this space. But I will give the basic ideas.
Imagine that you have a function <span class="math">\(G\)</span> that you are able to expand in a (complex) power series that
converges in a sense that it is simply not silly to act like it does:</p>
<div class="math">\begin{align}
G(z) &amp;= \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} c_k z^n \lt \infty\label{gf_def}\\ 
\end{align}</div>
<p>Suppose you have a recurrence relation for <span class="math">\(c_j = f(\left\{c_i : i &lt; j\right\})\)</span>.  There is
an arsenal not unlike that available for Fourier or Laplace transforms that allow you to derive from
that recurrence an analytic function <span class="math">\(G(z)\)</span>, which can be expanded into the form <span class="math">\((\ref{gf_def})\)</span>.
Then, a <em>closed-form</em> version of <span class="math">\(c_j\)</span> can read off from the <span class="math">\(c_k\)</span> in the series expansion.</p>
<p>We're not going to do any of that here.  But we are going to take some liberties and use the
machinery for our purposes.  To whit, the first thing we are going to do is realize that any series
sum that involves powers of things can be "converted" to a GF by taking some liberties and making
some suitable replacements.  Why would we want to do this?  Well, it all depends on how you choose
to interpret the coefficients.  In particular, if you interpret the <span class="math">\(c_k\)</span> as <em>probabilities</em>, then
you actually get something that is formally known as a probability generating function (PGF).</p>
<div class="math">\begin{align}
G(z) &amp;= \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} p_k z^k\nonumber\\
\end{align}</div>
<p>Notice a couple of things here: First, that <span class="math">\(G(1) = 1\)</span>.  Why? well 
</p>
<div class="math">\begin{align}
G(1) &amp;= \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} p_k 1^k\nonumber\\
    &amp;= \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} p_k = 1\nonumber\\
\end{align}</div>
<p>for everything that we consider to be a probability.  Also, notice that
</p>
<div class="math">\begin{align}
G'(z) &amp;= \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} k p_k z^{k-1}\nonumber\\
&amp;\implies G'(1) = \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} k p_k = E[n].\nonumber\\
\end{align}</div>
<p>Now this is useful!  If we are trying to do something like we tried in <span class="math">\((\ref{old_way})\)</span>, then now
have a general method. You may or may not believe me when I say this. Before I show you, let's
observe one more fact about PGFs. Suppose we find ourselves in a situation where we have a PGF that
looks something like this</p>
<div class="math">\begin{align}
G(z) &amp;= \frac{P(z)}{F(z)}\nonumber,\\
\end{align}</div>
<p>where <span class="math">\(P(z)\)</span> and <span class="math">\(F(z)\)</span> are some analytic functions of <span class="math">\(z\)</span>. Observe that</p>
<div class="math">\begin{align}
&amp;F'(z)\,G(z) + G'(z)\,F(z) = P'(z)\nonumber\\
&amp;\implies G'(1) = \frac{P'(1) - F'(1)}{F(1)}\\
\end{align}</div>
<p>If you have ever spent any time with partial fractions, you will know why we will want this result.
Now, let's use all of this on an unsuspecting sum to see if it works.  Equation <span class="math">\((\ref{S})\)</span> was of
interest to us, and it is clearly a power series.  So, lets make the replacements <span class="math">\(H \rightarrow pz\)</span>
and <span class="math">\(T \rightarrow qz\)</span> and see what happens. We will also promote our proto-PGF <span class="math">\(S \rightarrow G\)</span>.</p>
<div class="math">\begin{align}
G &amp;= p q z^2 \left(\frac{1}{1-pz} + \frac{1}{1-qz}\right) = \frac{P(z)}{F(z)}\nonumber\\
&amp;= \frac{p q z^2 \left(2-z\right)}{(1-pz)(1-qz)}\nonumber\\
P'(1)&amp;= p(1-p)\nonumber\\
F'(1)&amp;= 2p - 2p^2 -1\nonumber\\
G'(1)&amp;= \frac{p(1-p) - (2p -2p^2 - 1)}{p(1-p)}\nonumber\\
&amp;= \frac{p^2 - p + 1}{p(1-p)}.
\end{align}</div>
<p>We accomplished nothing, except to convince ourselves that our machinery works.</p>
<h3>The coin again, this time as a finite automaton</h3>
<p>We return now to the hint that <em>Knuth et. al.</em> gave us about using finite automata to help generate
our <span class="math">\(S\)</span>'s.  If we think about the coin problem we've been considering, a first stab at at
state machine could look something like this.</p>
<p><img alt="Alt Text" src="/images/coin.png" /></p>
<p>I hope by now you are comfortable and see the value in writing down a sum <span class="math">\(S\)</span>. So let's try it:
</p>
<div class="math">\begin{align}
S_0 &amp;= 1\nonumber\\
S_1 &amp;= TS_0 + TS_1 = T(1+S_1)\nonumber\\
S_2 &amp;= HS1\nonumber\\
S_3 &amp;= H(1+S3)\nonumber\\
S_4 &amp;= TS_3\nonumber\\
S &amp;= S_2 + S_4.\\
\end{align}</div>
<p>Here we have identified <span class="math">\(S_2\)</span> and <span class="math">\(S_4\)</span> as our terminal states. Solving we see that</p>
<div class="math">\begin{align}
S_2 &amp;= \frac{TH}{1-T}\nonumber\\
S_4 &amp;= \frac{TH}{1-H}\nonumber\\
S &amp; = TH \left(\frac{1}{1-H} + \frac{1}{1-T}\right)\nonumber.\\
\end{align}</div>
<p>This form should be familiar enough now that I don't have to convince you that this approach worked.</p>
<h3>The <span class="math">\(m\)</span>-die with equal probabilities</h3>
<p>We are now prepared to take on the type <span class="math">\((\ref{typeA})\)</span> problem for arbitrary <span class="math">\(m\)</span>.  As before, define a
finite automata to describe the process.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="/images/m-die.png" /></p>
<p>In this case we identify each state by
the number of <span class="math">\(m\)</span> types we have seen. Then, as before we can read off the proto-PGF</p>
<div class="math">\begin{align}
S_0 &amp;= 1\nonumber\\
S_1 &amp;= m X S_0 + X S_1 = \frac{m}{1-X}\,XS_0\nonumber\\
S_2 &amp;= \frac{(m - 1)}{1 - 2 X}\,XS_0\nonumber\\
S_k &amp;= \frac{(m - k + 1)}{1 - k X}\,XS_{k - 1}\nonumber\\
&amp;= f(X,m)_k\,XS_{k-1}\nonumber\\
S_m &amp;= XS_{m-1}.\nonumber\\
\end{align}</div>
<p>Writing down a few terms for small k of the recurrence let's us see a closed form</p>
<div class="math">\begin{align}
S_4 &amp;= X S_3 \nonumber\\
    &amp;= X^2 f(3)\,S_2 \nonumber\\
    &amp;= X^3 f(3)\,f(2)\,S_1 \nonumber\\
    &amp;= X^4 \prod_{k=1}^{3} f(k). \nonumber\\
\end{align}</div>
<p>This leads us to conclude that</p>
<div class="math">\begin{align}
S_m &amp;= X^m \prod_{k=1}^{m-1} \frac{m - k + 1}{1 - k X}\nonumber\\
    &amp;= m! X^m \prod_{k=1}^{m-1} \left(1 - k X \right)^{-1}.\nonumber\\
\end{align}</div>
<p>As before, we make the substitution <span class="math">\( X \rightarrow pz = z/m\)</span>, and we promote the proto-<span class="math">\(PGF\)</span> to a <span class="math">\(PGF\)</span>:</p>
<div class="math">\begin{align}
G(z) &amp;= \frac{m!}{m^m} z^m \prod_{k=1}^{m-1} (1-kz/m)^{-1}.\nonumber\\
\end{align}</div>
<p>Also, as before, we make the substitution <span class="math">\(G=z^{m}/F\)</span> and recall that
</p>
<div class="math">\begin{align}
E[n] = G'(1) = \frac{m - F'(1)}{F(1)} \label{mean}\\
\end{align}</div>
<p>Then
</p>
<div class="math">\begin{align}
F(z) &amp;= \frac{m^m}{m!} \prod_{k=1}^{m-1} (1- kz/m) = \frac{m^m}{m!} Q_m(z)\nonumber\\
F'(z) &amp;= \frac{-m^m}{m!} \frac{z}{m} Q_m(z) \sum_{k=1}^{m-1} \left(\frac{k}{1-kz/m}\right) \nonumber\\
      &amp;= -\frac{z}{m} F(z) \sum_{k=1}^{m-1} \left(\frac{k}{1-kz/m}\right) \nonumber\\
      &amp;= -z F(z) \sum_{k=1}^{m-1} \left(\frac{k}{m - kz}\right) \nonumber\\
      &amp;= z F(z) \sum_{k=1}^{m-1} \left(\frac{1}{z - m/k}\right) \label{Fprime}\\
\end{align}</div>
<p>Things are looking very promising.  Now we evaluate <span class="math">\(Q(1)\)</span>
</p>
<div class="math">\begin{align}
Q(1) &amp;= \frac{1}{m^{m-1}} \prod_{k=1}^{m-1} \left(m-k\right) \nonumber \\
     &amp;= \frac{1}{m^{m-1}} \left( (m-1)(m-2) \ldots \left( m - (m - 1) \right) \right)\nonumber \\
     &amp;= \frac{\left(m-1\right)!}{m^{m-1}}\nonumber\\
     &amp;= \frac{m!}{m^m}.\nonumber\\
\end{align}</div>
<p>Interestingly, this means that <span class="math">\(F(1) =1\)</span>, which also means that <span class="math">\(F\)</span> also behaves like a PGF.  At any
rate, we were now left with</p>
<div class="math">\begin{align}
F'(1) &amp;= \sum_{k=1}^{m-1} \frac{1}{1 - m/k}\nonumber\\
\end{align}</div>
<p>By now, we are tired and we resort to some <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~odonnell/toolkit13/how-to-do-math-and-tcs.pdf">street fighting</a>, <a href="https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=sum+1%2F(1-m%2Fk),+k%3D1+to+m-1">Wolfram Alpha</a>-style, which gives us
</p>
<div class="math">\begin{align}
F'(1) &amp;= m \left( 1 - \psi^{(0)} - \gamma\right) - 1\nonumber\\
      &amp;= m \left( 1 - (H_{m-1} - \gamma) - \gamma \right) - 1\nonumber\\
      &amp;= m \left( 1 - H_{m-1} \right) - 1\nonumber\\
\end{align}</div>
<p>using the fact that <span class="math">\(\psi^{(0)} = H_{m-1} - \gamma\)</span>. Of course, this fact is exactly what Alpha used
to give us the answer by re-arranging the sum.  Plugging this all in to <span class="math">\((\ref{mean})\)</span>, we finally get</p>
<div class="math">\begin{align}
G'(1) &amp;= E[n]\nonumber\\
      &amp;= m - \left(m - m H_{m-1} - 1 \right)\nonumber\\
      &amp;= 1 + m H_{m-1}\nonumber\\
      &amp;= mH_m\\
\end{align}</div>
<p>using <span class="math">\(H_m = H_{m-1} + 1/m\)</span>. This was our goal. </p>
<p>Now to answer the original question for the equally weighted <span class="math">\(m!\)</span>-die.  In general we can get a
on-sided confidence interval for <span class="math">\(n\)</span>, the number of times we "roll" until success, by using <span class="math">\(E[n]\)</span>
and Markov's inequality.  If we could be bothered to calculate the variance using the formula's
above, we could use Chebyshev's to get a two sided confidence interval. Anyway,</p>
<div class="math">\begin{align}
P(n &gt; k m H_m) &amp;\leq \frac{E[n]}{k m H_m}\nonumber\\
&amp;\leq \frac{1}{k}.\nonumber\\
\end{align}</div>
<p>Setting <span class="math">\(1/k = 0.05 \implies k = 20\)</span>. For example, for a six-sided die, for <span class="math">\(\epsilon = kmH_m\)</span>,</p>
<div class="math">\begin{align}
P(n &gt; \epsilon) &amp;\leq 0.05\nonumber\\
\epsilon &amp;\approx 300 
\end{align}</div>
<p>For a permutation of order <span class="math">\(6\)</span>, the 95% threshold is <span class="math">\(\approx 200000\)</span>.</p>
<p>Finally, for large <span class="math">\(m\)</span>, </p>
<div class="math">\begin{align}
H_m &amp;\approx \ln{m} + \gamma\nonumber\\
E[n] &amp;\approx m\left( \ln{m} + \gamma \right)\nonumber\\
\end{align}</div>
<h3>The Coupon Collector</h3>
<p>You are probably wondering why this article is called Coupon Collector. At this point I will link
the Wikipedia article on the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coupon_collector%27s_problem">Coupon Collector Problem</a>, because
you've been patient and frankly, it can't harm you now.  We didn't actually look at the answer to
the type <span class="math">\((\ref{typeA})\)</span> problem until long after we got the answer.  The derivation there clearly
works, but I find it unsettling.  In case you didn't care to click, they model the number of coupons
<span class="math">\(N\)</span> to get a complete collection as a sum of <span class="math">\(m\)</span> geometrically distributed variables <span class="math">\(n_i\)</span> each with
a different <span class="math">\(p_i\)</span>. Then</p>
<div class="math">\begin{align}
E[n] &amp;= \sum_{i=1}^m E[n_i] = \sum_{i=1}^m \frac{1}{p_i}\nonumber\\
 &amp;= \frac{m}{m} + \frac{m}{m-1} + ... + \frac{m}{1}\nonumber\\
 &amp;= m\left(1 + \frac{1}{2} + ... + \frac{1}{m}\right) = m H_m\nonumber\\
\end{align}</div>
<p>I still don't like thinking about this as a sum of geometric processes.  It also doesn't help us
when the <span class="math">\(p_i\)</span> don't have this specific relationship.</p>
