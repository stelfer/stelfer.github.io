                <div class="summary"><p>I am not a statistician by training or by profession. I like to think I know a few useful facts
about statistics, but the formal background is something that I tend to just backfill over time when
the occasion arises. This can mean that sometimes I forget (see the
<a href="/coupon-collector.html">The Coupon Collector</a>), or flat-out just don't know a lot
of relatively simple things that people with an actual education in the field see easily.  One
example of this came up recently while working on my current engineering project (which I will write
about in a future posts in this series).</p>
<p>I've been staring at exponentially distributed data on a regular basis in one form or another for at
least the last ten years.  In my previous job, I spent a lot of time with the statistics of VoIP
phone calls, trying to understand what's "normal", and what are symptoms of system pathologies, or
even the actions of fraudsters in the telephony networks.  In approaching this subject, I had never
yet studied queuing theory, but I had a lot of experience with Poisson processes in experimental
high energy physics. This meant that as I learned I had many ...</p>

<dd>I'm very excited to read about practical applications of SC.  The authors claim to have run a stable maching algorithm (Gale-Shapley) in a multi-party secure construction on the 2016 National Resident Matching Program. This means 35,000 participants for 30,000 slots matched in 18 hours.  Understanding of the details of SC improving...</dd>

I like it in a way I never liked <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Statistical-Learning-Adaptive-Processing-Communications/dp/8126528923/">Vapnik</a>. It also reminds me of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Classical-Theory-Fields-Fourth-Theoretical/dp/0750627689">The Classical Theory of Fields</a>, which was by far my favorite part of my physics education.

<dd>One of our interns this summer (<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/devangivivrekar">Devangi</a>) did her project on looking at differential privacy for machine learning and statistical models.  I'm catching up on some of the things they learned about secure computation.</dd>

yourself theoretical computer science is that you get to discover things like this on your own!</dd>

                <h2><a href="/coupon-collector.html">The Coupon Collector</a></h2>
                <div class="summary"><p>Once during a meeting in which we were discussing the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher%E2%80%93Yates_shuffle">Fischer-Yates shuffle</a>, someone asked:
"How many times do we need to run the algorithm to see every permutation?"  It immediately occurred
to me that, well, I didn't know.  Feeling my hands begin wave, instinctively, I fired back, I
thought, quite cleverly: "How many times do you need to flip a coin to see both sides?".  Of course,
both questions are somewhat non-sensical, but the intent of the former question, unlike the latter,
was clear. I didn't know the answer, but I've always said that stopping problems are the best
problems, so even though I didn't have a great answer in the moment, I resolved to find something
satisfying. At this point I will confess that I am an enthusiastic yet rank amateur
combinatorialist.  For whatever reason, I had never heard of the Coupon Collector.</p>
<p>This will take you on a seemingly circuitous path towards something that is in the end very simple,
and very beautiful.  I think it also proves that when all else fails, brute force counting can take
you a long way, provided you have the machinery to get you there.</p>
