                <p>Every so often, I return to my solvers for combinatorial puzzles like Sudoku. There's another game
that has a storied history in computer science, going back to Djikstra's
<a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD03xx/EWD316.9.html">introduction of backtracking</a> . The problem is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_queens_puzzle">Eight Queens</a>. The idea is to
find every position of a chess board that can support the simultaneous placement of eight queen
pieces. It turns out that there are 12 distinct positions that solve this problem. But if you look
at all of the possible solutions you find by backtracking, you actually find 96 solutions. The
difference comes from the internal symmetries of the chess board.</p>
<p>You can actually try this game for any number of queens, on any size board. This generalization is
call the n-queens problem. The non-distinct solutions for 6 queens on a 6x6 board is shown below.</p>
<figure>
<img src="images/6-queens.png">

<figcaption>

All solutions to placing 6 queens on a 6x6 chess board. The numbers indicate the number of queens
attacking that square.

</figcaption>

</figure>

<p>By starting at the top left, you can see that by rotating the board clockwise, you arrive at the top
right figure. By flipping horizontally, you arrive at the bottom left figure. By rotating
counter-clockwise, you arrive at the bottom right board.  There are different ways of dealing with
of pruning the non-unique boards, but the last time I played with my solver for n-queens, I tried
something I hadn't thought of before. This post will describe that idea.</p>
<p>Generating permutations is something I've always found fascinating. I spent many hours in my youth
(and adulthood) writing page after page of permutations trying to find a new way to algorithmically
generate them.  When I started looking at checking the n-queens solutions for symmetries, I began to
think of connections between generating permutations and checking symmetries. This is what I will
describe in this post. A jupyter notebook using what's discussed here can be found on my
<a href="https://github.com/stelfer/nqueens/blob/master/nqueens_D4.ipynb">github</a>. Pruning the backtracking by evaluating symmetries gave a 32x speedup for <span class="math">\(n=6\)</span>
(at the end of the notebook).</p>
<h3>Symmetries of a Square</h3>
<p>So, what's the symmetry of a chess board anyway? The symmetries of regular polygons are captured by
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dihedral_group">Dihedral group</a>, <span class="math">\(D_n\)</span>. In particular, the symmetries of a n-gon is captured by
<span class="math">\(D_n\)</span>. A chessboard is an regular 4-gon, so it's symmetries are captured by <span class="math">\(D_4\)</span>. </p>
<p>What do I mean that <span class="math">\(D_4\)</span> captures the symmetries of a square? <span class="math">\(D_4\)</span> is generated by clock-wise and
counter-clockwise rotations of 90° and reflections about the vertical, horizontal and diagonal axes
of the square.</p>
<figure>
<img src="images/d4.png"/>
<figcaption>All of the symmetries of the square can be found by reflecting across the blue lines, or rotating clockwise or counter-clockwise around the center</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>If you think about that figure for a bit, you'll see that there are many ways to end up in the same
place. For instance, rotating the square clockwise puts the dark grey square in the bottom right
corner, but so does a reflection about the horizontal axis. Groups are full of these kind of hidden
and complicated relationships.  A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generating_set_of_a_group">generating set</a> captures the idea of a specific set
of transformations that are sufficient to generate the group.</p>
<p>If you've never seen this before, the systematic exploration of this is what group
theory is all about. I recommend <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Visual-Group-Theory-Problem-Book/dp/088385757X">Carter</a> for a friendly and geometrical introduction. For
an accessible introduction to generating sets, I recommend Keith Conrad's
<a href="http://www.math.uconn.edu/~kconrad/blurbs/grouptheory/genset.pdf">notes</a>. Keith has a wealth of good reading in his <a href="http://www.math.uconn.edu/~kconrad/blurbs/">blurbs</a>.</p>
<p>There is a visual way of encoding all of these relationships for a particular group, called a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cayley_graph">Cayley graph</a>. Cayley graphs use a particular generating set of transformations (like
reflection and rotation above), and show how you can arrive at every symmetry of your starting point
by sequentially applying transformations. The Wikipedia article on Cayley graphs actually has a
graph for <span class="math">\(D_4\)</span> in the example section</p>
<figure>

<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/97/Dih_4_Cayley_Graph%3B_generators_a%2C_b.svg/403px-Dih_4_Cayley_Graph%3B_generators_a%2C_b.svg.png">
<figcaption>

A Cayley graph of D4 using clockwise rotation (a) and horizontal reflection (b).

<figcaption>
</figure>

<p>To see what's happening here, start at the F labeled <span class="math">\(e\)</span>.  By applying <span class="math">\(a\)</span>, we go up along the red
arrow and we get an F that has been rotated 90 degrees in the clockwise direction. If you then
follow the blue line up and to the left, you are applying a horizontal reflection <span class="math">\(b\)</span>. If you moved
back along the blue line, you would go back to where you were before, and algebraically you would be
at <span class="math">\(abb\)</span>. But since <span class="math">\(bb = 1\)</span>, i.e. two reflection across the same axis take you back to the same
place, you end up algebraically back at <span class="math">\(a\)</span>. Rotations don't work like reflections. Two clockwise 90
degree rotations don't take you back where you started. Instead, <span class="math">\(aaaa = 1\)</span>. This is why the red
arrows have directions, and why there's an outside square and inside square of red arrows, that give
<span class="math">\(aaaa\)</span> to get you around to where you started.</p>
<p>So, what does this have to do with my original interest in symmetries of n-queens? Well, say we
start with a configuration of queens, such as in the top right solution above, how would I
algorithmically take that board on a tour of every symmetry it has under <span class="math">\(D_4\)</span>? If you look at the
Cayley graph above, you can imagine starting at <span class="math">\(e\)</span> and applying <span class="math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math">\(b\)</span> in a way to take us to
every other node. But how do we do this in a systematic way? How can we only visit each node once?
The answer from that Cayley graph is not obvious.</p>
<p>In computer science terms, we're asking of there exists at least one Hamiltonian path in that
graph, and if so, how do we find it. Finding Hamiltonian paths in graphs is one of the classic
NP-complete problems of computer science. We don't actually know if every Cayley graph is
Hamiltonian, but the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lov%C3%A1sz_conjecture">Lovász conjecture</a> posits that they are. And, the Lovász conjecture
has been proven for almost all cases of finite Cayley graphs. So, this gives us hope, but a
Hamiltonian path on Cayley graph for <span class="math">\(D_4\)</span> above it isn't immediately obvious, at least for me.</p>
<p>Remember that we only used two of the many possible transformations to make that graph. What about
if we used others, what would happen? Well, Wikipedia is way ahead of us. They display another
Cayley graph for <span class="math">\(D_4\)</span> on the same page:</p>
<figure>

<figcaption>

</figcaption>

</figure>

<p>Here <span class="math">\(c = ba\)</span>. You may also recognize it as a reflection along the diagonal axis running from SE to
NW (or between the two light grey boxes in the figure above). Notice also that in writing <span class="math">\(c = ba\)</span>,
the order of <span class="math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math">\(b\)</span> matter. Except for <span class="math">\(D_1\)</span> and <span class="math">\(D_2\)</span>, the generators of <span class="math">\(D_n\)</span> do not
commmute, i.e. <span class="math">\(D_n\)</span> for <span class="math">\(n &gt; 2\)</span> are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abelian_group">non abelian</a>. You can see this from the
figure above. If you look at <span class="math">\(bc\)</span> and <span class="math">\(cb\)</span>, you'll see they aren 't the same thing. The non abelian
structure generally makes the Cayley graph a hall of mirrors when you are trying to find a path through it.</p>
<p>At any rate, in this Cayley graph, you can immediately see the circuit we can take to evaluate all
of the symmetries of a n-queens position. Typically in an n-queens solver you represent the board as
an <span class="math">\(n \times n\)</span> matrix. in this setting, evaluating reflections is as simple as swapping matrix
entries seven times. In my solver, every time I find a solution by backtracking, I quickly check the
board against solutions that I've saved before. Doing this at the time of finding a solution greatly
speeds up the backtracking since it substantially prunes the tree.</p>
<h3>Hamiltonian Paths for Permutations</h3>
<p>As I mentioned before, I've always been interested in generating permutations. Just as the
symmetries of a square are captured by <span class="math">\(D_4\)</span>, The <span class="math">\(n!\)</span> ways of arranging <span class="math">\(n\)</span> objects is captured by
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric_group">symmetric group</a> <span class="math">\(S_n\)</span> on <span class="math">\(n\)</span> objects. The symmetric group is of fundamental
importance in group theory due to it's broad application, and by
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cayley%27s_theorem">Cayley's Theorem</a>, which provides a correspondence between <em>any</em> group and
subgroups of the symmetric group.</p>
<p>Wikipedia gives us a Cayley graph for <span class="math">\(S_4\)</span>, the symmetric group on four items.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b5/Symmetric_group_4%3B_Cayley_graph_4%2C9.svg/812px-Symmetric_group_4%3B_Cayley_graph_4%2C9.svg.png" width="25%"/>

<figcaption>

A Cayley graph for S4. Red arrow rotates the items to the right, while the blue arrow swaps the first and second, then second and third items.

</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This time <span class="math">\(e\)</span> is in the bottom left corner at <span class="math">\(1234\)</span>. A red arrow takes every item and moves it one
position to the right, with the ends wrapping around to the other side.  This type of transformation
is called a path. A blue arrow performs two trandsformations, first swapping the the first and
second item, then the second and third item. The fourth stays the same. These types of
transformations are called transpositions, or I call them swaps.</p>
<p>As another way of visualizing permutations, we can look at the notation used for cycles and
swaps. Over <span class="math">\(S_3\)</span>, a 3-cycle that simultaneously moves the first to the second, second to third,
etc, we write <span class="math">\((123)\)</span>. If we write out the <span class="math">\(3! = 6\)</span> 3-cycles of <span class="math">\(S_3\)</span>, we get </p>
<div class="math">$$ 
(123)\\
(132)\\
(213)\\
(231)\\
(312)\\
(321)\\
$$</div>
<p>Some of these do the same thing, for instance <span class="math">\((123)\)</span> and <span class="math">\((231)\)</span>, but <span class="math">\((123)\)</span> and <span class="math">\((132)\)</span> do
something different. But what's clear from writing it out that we have a cycle for each actual
permutation of 3 objects.  Because of this, we conclude that the cyles of any permutation group
generates the group. Taking the cycles as the generating set has an obvoius disadvantage when you
are trying to algorithmically generate permutations: you have to already have the permutations to
make the generating set. It would be nice to be able to use a more compact set of
generators. Luckily this is possible.</p>
<p>Generating permutations exhaustively requires <span class="math">\(n!\)</span> amount of work. For large <span class="math">\(n\)</span>, this can get
literally astronomical.  I mentioned the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher%E2%80%93Yates_shuffle">Fischer-Yates shuffle</a> in the post on the
<a href="coupon-collector.html">Coupon Collector</a>.  If you are not familiar with that algorithm, it uniformly generates random
permutations.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">for</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">i</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="n">i</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="n">n</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="n">i</span><span class="o">++</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="n">swap</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">a</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">i</span><span class="p">],</span> <span class="n">a</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">rand</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">i</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">n</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)]);</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Part of the reason I have spent so much time thinking about F-Y because of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Algorithm-Design-Manual-Steven-Skiena/dp/1849967202"><em>Skiena</em></a>, where he asks why the following does not generate uniformly random permutations:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">for</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">i</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="n">i</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="n">n</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="n">i</span><span class="o">++</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="n">swap</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">a</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">i</span><span class="p">],</span> <span class="n">a</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">rand</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">n</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)]);</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Analyzing the algorithm, in particular why it generates uniformly random permutations, and why this
second snippet doesn't, is my favorite interview question. Maybe I will post about that later. But
for now, taking a step back, why do we think that generating permutations by swaps would even work?</p>
<p>Well we've seen that swaps have a role to play in the Cayley graph above for <span class="math">\(S_4\)</span>. But that
generating set also uses cycles. F-Y doesn't use cycles, just swaps. Using a similar formalism to
the way we write cycles, we can also write swaps. In particular, we write the exchange of the first
and second elements as <span class="math">\((12)\)</span>. A moments reflection tells us that:</p>
<div class="math">$$
(1234) = (12)(23)(34) = \sigma_{12} \sigma_{23} \sigma_{34}\\
$$</div>
<p>I wrote the <span class="math">\(\sigma\)</span>'s because we are going to watch them in action and don't want to create too
much confusion with paranthesis. Note also that the permutations apply by acting on the right.  We
will also use letters rather than numbers to keep the confusion at a minimum</p>
<div class="math">\begin{aligned}
\sigma_{34}(ABCD) &amp;\rightarrow ABDC\\
\sigma_{23}(ABDC) &amp;\rightarrow ADBC\\
\sigma_{12}(ADBC) &amp;\rightarrow DABC.\\
\end{aligned}</div>
<p>Which gives us the same result as the cycle <span class="math">\((1234)\)</span>. So, cycles are products of <span class="math">\(n-1\)</span> swaps.  Since
cycles generate symmetry groups, that means that swaps also generate the symmetry groups. We can now
see why F-Y is a good idea, or at least why it might work.</p>
<p>There are <span class="math">\(\binom{n}{2} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}\)</span> swaps for <span class="math">\(S_n\)</span>. So, if we want to use swaps to
algorithmically generate permutations, then we only have to do <span class="math">\(\binom{n}{2}\)</span> work finding the
generators before we can start making permutations. This saves a lot of work. But we can do even
better. It turns out that for any <span class="math">\(n \geq 2\)</span>, <span class="math">\(S_n\)</span> is generated by <span class="math">\((12)\)</span> and <span class="math">\((12...n)\)</span>. A proof
is found at Keith Conrad's <a href="http://www.math.uconn.edu/~kconrad/blurbs/grouptheory/genset.pdf">notes</a>. This means we can use the same generating set for
any <span class="math">\(n\)</span>, and the only upfront work we have to do is in creating the cycle.</p>
<p>Back to using swaps. One day a few years ago I was writing out permutations, and I found the
following pattern.  For any <span class="math">\(n\)</span>, write out the <span class="math">\(n-1\)</span> swaps in columns. Start with <span class="math">\(e\)</span>, for the case
of <span class="math">\(S_4\)</span>, that's <span class="math">\(1234\)</span>. Move the permutation to the right using the swap in the column until you
get to the end of a row. When you get to the right side of the table, go down with the first swap
<span class="math">\((12)\)</span>. Then go back across the table the other direction until you hit the left side of the
table. Then go down with the last swap of the set. Keep this up until you get back to <span class="math">\(e\)</span>. This
process is shown below.</p>

<p>This works for any <span class="math">\(n\)</span>. So, this is an algorithmic way to construct a Hamiltonian path on the
Cayley graph for <span class="math">\(S_n\)</span>. It allows us to systematically generate permutations. At first I was
excited, but after some research I learned that this was figured out in the 1960's. This algorithm is
called the Johnson-Steinhaus-Trotte (JST) solution to the motel problem. The motel problem comes from
Martin Gardner's <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Time-Travel-Other-Mathematical-Bewilderments/dp/0716719258">Time Travel and other Mathematical Bewilderments</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mr. Smith manages a motel. It consists of n rooms in a straight row. There is no vacancy. Smith is a psychologist who plans to study the effects of rearranging his guests in all possible ways. Every morning he gives them a permutation. The weather is miserable, raining almost daily. To minimize his guests’ discomfort, each daily rearrangement is made by exchanging only the occupants of two adjoining rooms. Is there a simple algorithm that will run through all possible rearrangements by switching only one pair of adjacent occupants at each step?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It turns out this problem is even older than that. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1203.1835"><em>McGuire</em></a> describes the history of this problem dating back to the 17th century:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Suppose there are n bells being rung, numbered 1,2,3,...,n in order of pitch, number 1 being the highest. When the bells are rung in order of descending pitch 1, 2, 3, . . . , n, we say they are being rung in rounds. A change in the order of the bells, such as rounds 1 2 3 4 5 being changed to 2 1 4 3 5, can be considered as a permutation in the symmetric group on five objects. In the years 1600–1650 a new craze emerged where the ringers would continuously change the order of the bells for as long as possible, while not repeating any particular order, and return to rounds at the end. This game evolved into a challenge to ring the bells in every possible order, without any repeats, and return to rounds.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>McGuire</em> plausibly claims that the method above was actually discovered by bell-ringers in the
1650's. JST only solves one variant of the large topic of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Change_ringing">change ringing</a>. <em>McGuire</em>
provides a nice history of this and ties it back to Hamilton paths on Cayley graphs. The Simons
Foundation has a nice <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lyDCUKsWZs">video</a> on the topic.</p>
